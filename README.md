Project Overview -
This project analyzes the Google Play Store Apps dataset using Python on Kaggle to uncover factors that influence app success. It addresses business questions related to app ratings,
installs, user reviews, app size, and pricing.

All case study questions (Basic, Medium, Advanced) were solved using Python in a Kaggle notebook.

Business Objectives -
Identify key drivers of high app ratings ,
Understand user preferences and behaviors ,
Explore the impact of app size, category, and price ,
Provide actionable insights for app development and marketing strategies
